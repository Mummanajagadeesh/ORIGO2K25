We represent the official robotics club of our college, driven by a shared passion for robotics.  

The team at the Robotics Interest Group, also known as RIG, consists of undergraduate students from various disciplines, including Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Science, spanning sophomores to final-year students.
