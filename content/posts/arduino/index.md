Getting Started with Arduino

## What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform designed to make working with hardware and software accessible to everyone. It consists of two main components:  
1. **Physical programmable circuit board (microcontroller):** A small computer capable of interacting with electronic components like sensors, LEDs, and motors.  
2. **Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** Software used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.  

Arduino boards are widely used for prototyping and creating interactive electronic projects in fields like robotics, IoT, and automation.

## Arduino UNO Microcontroller

The **Arduino UNO** is one of the most popular boards in the Arduino family. It features:  
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega328P  
- **Operating Voltage:** 5V  
- **Digital I/O Pins:** 14 (6 of which support PWM output)  
- **Analog Input Pins:** 6  
- **Flash Memory:** 32 KB

## Arduino IDE

The **Arduino IDE** is the official software used to program Arduino boards. It offers an intuitive interface and various features to simplify coding and hardware interaction.

### Key Features of Arduino IDE:
- **Baud Rate:**  
  - Baud rate refers to the number of bits transmitted per second. It determines the speed of communication between the Arduino and your computer.  
  - For example, a baud rate of 9600 means 9600 bits per second are being transferred.

- **Serial Monitor:**  
  - The **Serial Monitor** is a tool accessible from the IDE, allowing you to send and receive data between your computer and the Arduino board in real time.  
  - It’s useful for debugging, monitoring sensor data, and interacting with your programs.  
  - To open the Serial Monitor, click the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the IDE.

- **Board and Serial Port Selection:**  
  - Before uploading a program, you must select the correct board (e.g., Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega) and serial port.  
  - These options are available in the **Tools** menu.  
  - A serial port is a communication interface used to transfer data between the Arduino and your computer.

- **Help Menu:**  
  - The IDE includes references for beginners, including **Help/Getting Started** and **Help/Reference**, which provide tutorials and documentation.  

- **File Menu:**  
  - **Sketchbook:** Stores all saved sketches (programs).  
  - **Examples:** Offers pre-built example codes for beginners to practice and learn.

## Arduino IDE Interface

The IDE interface includes:  
1. **Toolbar:** Buttons for common actions like uploading code, verifying syntax, and opening the Serial Monitor.  
2. **Code Editor:** Space to write and edit your sketches.  
3. **Console:** Displays error messages, compile status, and debug information.  
4. **Menu Bar:** Provides access to tools, settings, and references.

## Common Arduino Commands

Here are some of the most important commands used in Arduino programming:

1. **`pinMode()`**  
   Sets a pin on the Arduino as input or output.  
   ```cpp
   pinMode(pin, INPUT/OUTPUT);
   ```

2. **`digitalWrite()`**  
   Writes a HIGH or LOW value to a digital pin.  
   ```cpp
   digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW);
   ```

3. **`digitalRead()`**  
   Reads the value from a specified digital pin, either HIGH or LOW.  
   ```cpp
   digitalRead(pin);
   ```

4. **`delay()`**  
   Pauses the program for a specified time in milliseconds.  
   ```cpp
   delay(time);
   ```

5. **`analogRead()`**  
   Reads an analog signal using the built-in analog-to-digital converter.  
   ```cpp
   analogRead(pin);
   ```

6. **`analogWrite()`**  
   Generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal on a specified pin.  
   ```cpp
   analogWrite(pin, value);
   ```

## Example of a Simple Arduino Sketch

Here’s a basic example of controlling an LED using Arduino:

```cpp
int ledPin = 13; // Pin connected to the LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // Set pin as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // Turn the LED off
  delay(1000);                // Wait for 1 second
}
```
