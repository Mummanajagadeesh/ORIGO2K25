## **What is CAD?**

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a technology that allows users to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world products. This powerful tool facilitates the design, simulation, and modification of prototypes before they are manufactured. CAD enables seamless collaboration among teams, leading to the development of innovative, high-quality products that can reach the market faster.

## **CAD Software/Tools**

CAD software provides specialized tools tailored to different industries, such as architecture, industrial design, and electronics. Some CAD tools are versatile and can be used across a variety of fields, while others are industry-specific. Below is a list of widely used CAD tools:

- **SolidWorks**
- **AutoCAD**
- **Fusion 360**
- **CATIA**
- **TinkerCad**
- **CREO**
- **Onshape**
- **SIEMENS NX**
- **LibreCAD**
- **DraftSight**
- **Solid Edge**
- **Altium Designer**

## **Onshape: Cloud-Based CAD Software**

Onshape is a cutting-edge, cloud-based CAD platform. It allows users to collaborate in real time on a single model through web-based servers, making it an ideal choice for industries involved in product design, machine parts, and industrial equipment. 

### **Key Features of Onshape:**
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on the same design simultaneously, streamlining the design process.
- **Document Organization:** Instead of native file formats, Onshape stores design data within "Documents," which act as project-level containers. These containers hold assemblies, parts, drawings, imported components, and other project-related data.
- **Cross-Compatibility:** Supports importing and exporting files in multiple industry-standard formats.
- **Cloud-Based Access:** Accessible through compatible web browsers after signing in.

## **PCB Design: An Overview**

### **What is PCB Design?**
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design involves creating layouts for PCBs, which serve as the foundation for electronic circuits. A PCB provides the platform where electrical components like resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits are mounted and electrically connected.

### **Why Simulate PCB Designs?**
Simulation in PCB design ensures:
- **Error Detection:** Identify and fix issues before physical fabrication.
- **Flexibility:** Easy testing of circuit performance under various scenarios.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces material wastage during testing phases.
